# US Housing Price Forecasting

## Project Overview

Forecasting median US house sale prices using time series analysis and machine learning. This project compares a benchmark autoregressive model (AR3) against a Lasso regression model incorporating macroeconomic predictors.

## TLDR;

Even with CV of different lagged variables in the Lasso model, the improvement in the residuals is marginal.
-> **Future food for thought**: Explore different ML techniques that introduce nonlinear relationships at the cost of explainability.
